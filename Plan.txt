Choices
    Break down refreshes into seconds?
        Worried about if it is a shitty computer seconds will show longer
    Do monsters literally drop the money or automatic-deposit?
        If I have time I think I will make it drop and then make a purchase for "Direct Deposit" lol
    Overtime
       Maybe take away money if you take too long to complete level
    Maybe do a full screen mode if I have time?
        Or maybe just adjust resolution?
    Decide the contents of the side buttons
    Where to store this when it is done?

    Find out why if budget + 10000 causes the numbers to freak out
    Split checkCollisions to put more stuff in levelTick because the former is bloated.
    Why is there a black box in the top left side of the canvas
    Maybe remove or split the movements into two files, one with input coordinates and one without
        Or maybe see if they can all do without input.
        A lot of them may be able to be combined.
        Might be able to combine a lot of the common functions between all of the different 'movements'
    Move the logic for the tombstone to movementManager.js
    Maybe look into making the assetLoader operate off of objects instead of arrays so I don't have to use build functions later
    Change the logic on the slide based menus to not write and rewrite the same text and use global alpha
    Allow to skip the committed victory screen if J or Space is pressed
